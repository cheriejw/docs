> The moral of the story is ASMX is simple and because it is simple, it isnâ€™t very powerful.  Take the time to learn about WCF because this is the future of the .Net platform, thus it will be time wisely spent.
[WCF VS ASMX](http://keithelder.net/2008/10/17/wcf-vs-asmx-webservices/)
[S.O.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2448472/what-are-the-differences-between-wcf-and-asmx-web-services)

ASMX is:
- easy and simple to write and configure
- only available in IIS
- only callable from HTTP

WCF can be:
- hosted in IIS, a Windows Service, a Winforms application, a console app - you have total freedom
- used with HTTP (REST and SOAP), TCP/IP, MSMQ and many more protocols
