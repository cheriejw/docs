## **Any programming language of course serves two goals:**
- Provide instructions to the computer.
- Leave a record of the intentions of the programmer.

>Though C# as a language was originally developed at Microsoft as part of .NET Framework, it was later standardised by ECMA, meaning that independent standard-compliant implementations of the language can be developed, and indeed they were. The most prominent of those is Mono.

[Switch Statement Fallthrough in C# Language Design](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/174155/switch-statement-fallthrough-in-c)
>**In summary therefore:**
-- C# no longer relates to unoptimised compiler output as directly as C code did 40 years ago (nor does C these days), which makes one of the inspirations of fall-through irrelevant.
-- C# remains compatible with C in not just having implicit break, for easier learning of the language by those familiar with similar languages, and easier porting.
-- C# removes a possible source of bugs or misunderstood code that has been well-documented as causing problems for the last four decades.
-- C# makes existing best-practice with C (document fall through) enforceable by the compiler.
-- C# makes the unusual case the one with more explicit code, the usual case the one with the code one just writes automatically.
-- C# uses the same goto-based approach for hitting the same block from different case labels as is used in C. It just generalises it to some other cases.
-- C# makes that goto-based approach more convenient, and clearer, than it is in C, by allowing  case statements to act as labels.-
**All in all, a pretty reasonable design decision**

Console.WriteLine(value: "Foo"); 
//prints Foo
Console.WriteLine(vale: "Foo");

> The moral of the story is ASMX is simple and because it is simple, it isnâ€™t very powerful.  Take the time to learn about WCF because this is the future of the .Net platform, thus it will be time wisely spent.
[WCF VS ASMX](http://keithelder.net/2008/10/17/wcf-vs-asmx-webservices/)
[S.O.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2448472/what-are-the-differences-between-wcf-and-asmx-web-services)

ASMX is:
- easy and simple to write and configure
- only available in IIS
- only callable from HTTP

WCF can be:
- hosted in IIS, a Windows Service, a Winforms application, a console app - you have total freedom
- used with HTTP (REST and SOAP), TCP/IP, MSMQ and many more protocols
